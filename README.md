# Knapsack Problem with Genetic Algorithms
> The project aims to effectively solve the knapsack problem using a genetic algorithm. Within the developed solution, the selection of items for placement in the knapsack is carried out through an analysis of both their values and weights. The genetic algorithm, which is a key tool in the project, allows for precise tuning of the item selection process to achieve an optimal value of accommodated items while simultaneously adhering to the weight constraints of the knapsack.
> By utilizing flexible parameters of the genetic algorithm, there is an opportunity to customize its operation to achieve the desired results. These parameters can encompass aspects such as the number of generations, population size, selection operators, crossover, and mutation. Adapting these parameters to the specific knapsack problem enables the optimization of the algorithm's efficiency and increases the likelihood of finding an optimal or near-optimal solution.

## Technologies Used
